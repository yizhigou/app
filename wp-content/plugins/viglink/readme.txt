The easiest way to monetize your content.  VigLink automatically affiliates your links (even on pages you've already written) and provides stats.

== Description ==
VigLink is a tool to make participation in affiliate programs easier. We handle the work of link affiliation and maintenance so that you can focus on creating great content.

By installing VigLink on your site, you instantly participate in the affiliate programs of thousands of cooperating merchants. Links are neither added nor removed from the page, VigLink affiliates existing links. We also provide outbound link reports (data Google Analytics does not offer) giving you insight into where your readers are going and what they do when they get there.

VigLink takes a cut only of new revenue you earn so there is no risk. Existing affiliate links are not touched and you benefit from collective bargaining, ensuring maximum compensation for your traffic.  For links we affiliate, VigLink takes 25% of the commissions you earn.

When clicks leave your site, you are creating value.  VigLink is the easiest and most complete way to measure and capture that value.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= What is VigLink? =

VigLink enables you to get paid for doing what you normally do on your blog or site. Whenever you link to a product, website, or promotion, VigLink turns that link into an affiliate link so that you receive a commission for any purchases made.

= How do I get started? =

As part of the installation you do need to create and account at [viglink.com](http://www.viglink.com/users/signup). Then follow the instructions on the installation tab.

= What's the difference between a link and an affiliate link? =

On your webpage you probably already link to a number of recommended products or companies, but only affiliate links allow you to get paid if one of your visitors makes a purchase at the linked site. Specifically, an affiliate link tells a site that its customer has come from your site, so you can receive a commission on the sale.

= Can't I just create an affiliate link myself? =

Of course--but it's time-consuming to enroll in a program, ensure that you have the correct affiliate links, and then manage that program. By contrast, one quick install of the VigLink library on your page enrolls you in all relevant affiliate programs quickly and easily. Plus, we'll administer everything so that you don't have to!

= How does VigLink make money? =

You earn a commission for every sale made on a linked site. VigLink takes a small fee from that commission and then passes on the rest to you.

= So what's happening underneath? =

After you embed the VigLink library on your page, it monitors when visitors click on a link pointing to a different site. The library checks to see if the URL of that link can be affiliated; if so, the link is automatically affiliated.

= Will my users notice? =

Likely not. VigLink does not change the user experience one bit. No links are inserted or removed on the page, there are no double-underlines or pop-ups, and mousing over a link looks "clean."

= How does payment work? =

VigLink will pay by check in the United States and PayPal anywhere it is available. We are expanding our payment options over time. VigLink will ask for payment information and pay publishers as soon as their balance reaches $25.

= What happens if VigLink goes down? =

VigLink has been designed for high reliability. In case it is unreachable for some reason, your page will be not be affected. All that will happen is that, temporarily, your links will not be affiliated.

= I have more questions, where do I go? =
